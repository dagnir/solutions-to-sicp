#Solutions to SICP
My Name is Dongie Agnir and these are my personal solutions to the second
edition of *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*.  I've put them
up so that others working through the book can have a place to compare their
solutions to since the book itself does not contain any.  Have fun!

The source for this this book can be found on my
[Github](https://www.github.com/dagnir/solutions-to-sicp).  Feel free to send
pull requests to correct any mistakes such as spelling (I'm sure there are
many!).
